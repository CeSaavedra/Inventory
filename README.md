# Inventory Program

This program prompts the user with a menu with six functional menu choices. These menu choices allow the user to manipulate a widget containing information about the product ID (Sku), name of production, size, quantity, and price.
The menu choices allow the user to add a new entry, remove an entry, search for an entry, calculate total value of inventory, display inventory, and end the program. The program allows these manipulations until the user decides to end the program.

This program demonstrates the ability to manipulate a list of information. This program highlights the ability to use java for real world applications.
